# OpticalFlow3D Python Implementation

# Dependencies

The calculation and visualization tools described below require the following Python packages:

- colorcet
- matplotlib
- natsort
- numpy
- pandas
- pathlib
- scipy
- tifffile

A Conda environment file for Windows systems is provided in `opticalflow3D.yml`. If you do not already have an entry point to Conda commands, [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) is a free tool that you can use to get started. Learn more about Miniforge and Conda in [this FocalPlane blog post by Robert Haase](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2022/12/08/managing-scientific-python-environments-using-conda-mamba-and-friends/). Once you have Conda set up, you can create an environment for OpticalFlow3D using the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f opticalflow3D.yml
```

# Usage

## Optical Flow Calculation

The actual calculation of optical flow is performed by the functions `calc_flow3D` and `calc_flow2D`, for 3D and 2D image sequences respectively. These functions are contained within the `calc_flow.py` module. Inputs are an image sequence and three smoothing parameters. The only differences in usage between the two functions are (1) whether a 4D or 3D matrix of images is input, and (2) whether flow in the axial direction, $v_z$, is output.

```Python
calc_flow2D(images,xySig=3,tSig=1,wSig=4)

calc_flow3D(images,xyzSig=3,tSig=1,wSig=4)
```

Input images should be of the format $N_t \times N_z \times N_y \times N_x$, with the $N_z$ dimension excluded for 2D processing.

`xyzSig` is the standard deviation used for Gaussian spatial smoothing and has a default value of 3. Larger values will remove noise but also remove spatial detail.

`tSig` is the standard deviation used for Gaussian temporal smoothing and has a default value of 1. Larger values remove noise but also remove temporal detail.

`wSig` is the standard deviation used for Gaussian weighting of the Lucas-Kanade neighborhood. Larger values create a larger neighborhood for the linear algebra solution, and will smooth over small spatial features in the flow.

## Image Parsing

The function `process_flow` (also contained in `calc_flow.py`) organizes image sequences into the format required by `calc_flow3D` and `calc_flow2D`. If you have a non-tif file type, this function must be adapted to your images.

In addition to the three smoothing parameters described in [Calculation](#optical-flow-calculation), this function requires details about the images to be processed.

```Python
process_flow(imDir,imName,fileType="SequenceT",spatialDimensions=3,xyzSig=3,tSig=1,wSig=4)
```

`imDir` is the full path to folder of image(s) to process.

`imName` is the name of the image(s) to process. For a single multi-page tif, this is simply the name of the tif file. For an image series composed of multiple tif files, the imName must be specified with a wildcard (`.*`) for the time expression in the file names. For example, for a list of files with the names:
- myexperiment_t000_ch0.tif
- myexperiment_t001_ch0.tif
- myexperiment_t002_ch0.tif,

the correct ImName would be `'myexperiment_t.*_ch0'`.

`fileType` can be either `'OneTif'` or `'SequenceT'`. For the `'OneTif'` type, the entire timelapse and all z-slices are assumed to be saved in one single tif file, and it is assumed the metadata is in the format generated by [ImageJ/FIJI](https://fiji.sc/). For the `'SequenceT'` type, the images are assumed to be saved as a sequence, with one tif per time point (but all z-slices per time point saved in one tif file).

`spatialDimensions` can be either 2 or 3 based on the number of spatial dimensions of the input data.

## Optical Flow Outputs

The function `process_flow` excludes the first and last $3 \times tSig$ time points from analysis to avoid edge effects.

For each analyzed time point, the function saves four tif files (three for 2D processing). These files correspond to the intensity changes in each directory ($v_x$, $v_y$, $v_z$), and reliability values (rel) for that time point. Each tif is saved with float precision.

## Example Scripts

The `example_processing_script.m` file provides an example of using process flow to analyze a set of images. Example 1 shows how to analyze a series of files (i.e., the `'SequenceT'` type), and Example 2 shows how to process multiple folders of `'OneTif'` format files at once.

In `example_analysis_script.m`, the output of the processing script is visualized and analyzed. This analysis requires the image directory and the name of the dataset, as well as metadata about the images. Analysis parameters include a reliability threshold value and parameters to control the visualization. The outputs of this script include visualization of the reliability mask, a quiver visualization of magnitude, and distributions of magnitude and theta.
